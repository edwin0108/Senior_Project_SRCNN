# Senior_Project_SRCNN

Tensorflow implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks for super-resolution. Base on paper [Learning a Deep Convolutional Network for Image Super-Resolution](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/files/eccv_2014_deepresolution.pdf)



## Documentation

[Click here](https://github.com/edwin0108/Senior_Project_SRCNN/tree/master/doc) for more information of our project. 



## Prerequisites

- Python 3.5.x (since Tensorflow-gpu only support up to python 3.5.x)
- Tensorflow.Keras ([Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/guide/keras.ipynb#scrollTo=9NR6reyk0E2A) to learn about Kears)



## Dataset

For now, please use `91-images` as our train dataset and `set5` as our validation dataset as they are  relatively small (you can find them at data folder). We will use `DIV2K` dataset for final evaluation.
